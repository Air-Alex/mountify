#### Globally mounted modules and whiteouts via OverlayFS.

- mostly meant for [MKSU .nomount](https://github.com/5ec1cff/KernelSU/commit/76bfccd11f4c8953b35e1342a2461f45b7d21c22)
- tries to mimic an OEM mount, like /mnt/vendor/my_bigball
- susfs is recommended for hiding mounts
- requires **CONFIG_OVERLAY_FS=y** and **CONFIG_TMPFS_XATTR=y** 
- globally mounting huge modules is discouraged

## Methodology
### module mount
1. copies contents of `/data/adb/modules/module_id` to `/mnt/vendor/fake_folder_name`
2. mirrors SELinux context of every file from `/data/adb/modules/module_id` to `/mnt/vendor/fake_folder_name`
3. overlay `/mnt/vendor/fake_folder_name/system/bin` to `/system/bin`
### whiteouts
1. generate whiteouts on `/debug_ramdisk/mountify/wo`
2. copy those whiteouts to `/mnt/vendor/whiteout`
3. overlay `/mnt/vendor/whiteout/system/bin` to `/system/bin`

## Why Itâ€™s Done This Way
- Magic mount drastically increases mount count, making detection possible (zimperium)
- OverlayFS mounting with ext4 image upperdir is detectable due to it creating device nodes on /proc/fs, while yes ext4 /data as overlay source is possible, who uses that nowadays?
- F2FS /data as overlay source fails with native casefolding (ovl_dentry_weird), so only sdcardfs users can use /data as overlay source.
- Frankly I dont see a way to this module mounting situation, this shit is more of a shitty band-aid 

## Usage
- edit config.sh, `mountify_mounts=1` then modify modules.txt to list modules you want mounted.

```
module_id fake_folder_name
```

- edit config.sh, `mountify_whiteouts=1` then modify whiteouts.txt for files you want whited out.

```
/system/bin/find
```

## Limitations
- Native whiteout method tends to fail on most setups. I still do NOT know why.

## Support / Warranty
- None, none at all. I am handing you a sharp knife, it is not on me if you stab yourself with it.
